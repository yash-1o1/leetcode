# convert the given decimal to binary
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 11
# Output: 1011
# Explanation: The input decimal number 11 has a binary representation 1011.
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 128
# Output: 10000000


# the first approach is to use the following logic:
# to convert decimal to binary, divide the decimal by 2 and store the remainder
# repeat the process until the quotient is 0
# the binary number is the sequence of remainders in reverse order
#
# we cam use another alternative approach to solve this problem:
# to convert decimal to binary, divide the decimal by 2 and store the quotient
# repeat the process until the quotient is 0
# the binary number is the sequence of remainders in reverse order
